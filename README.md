Obligatory Rap Bot

It seems to be the thing to do when you're venturing out on your own and starting to build some neural nets. I figure it'll be a good way to various methods for language modeling.

Goals
[] Recurrent rap lm (word and char)
[] Convolutional rap lm (same as above)
[] Rhyme Scheme (not sure about this one...)
